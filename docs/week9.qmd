## Summary

### Synthetic Aperture Radar.

1.  Active sensors

2.  Have surface texture data

3.  See through weather and clouds

4.  Different wavelengths - different applications

**Penetration**: Longer wavelengths (L and P bands) can penetrate deeper into vegetation and the ground, making it suitable for subsurface, biomass and soil moisture studies.

**Spatial Resolution**:Shorter wavelengths (X and C bands) generally provide higher spatial resolution, which facilitates detailed mapping and surveillance applications.

**Atmospheric conditions**:Different wavelengths interact significantly with the atmosphere; longer wavelengths are generally less affected by atmospheric humidity.

**Target characteristics**: The nature of the target area (urban, agricultural, forest, etc.) influences the selection of the optimal wavelength for imaging and data extraction.

### InSAR or DInSAR

1.  SAR = Active sensor, records energy reflected back through clouds.
2.  InSAR = Used in DEMs to convert phase differences to relative heights.
3.  DInSAR = time variation between two images. Observe movement of land (uplift or subsidence) with topography removed (using DEM)

## Application

1.  **Topographic mapping**: generation of high-resolution topographic maps and elevation data[@geymen2014; @musa2015].
2.  **Environmental monitoring**: observation of environmental changes such as changes in forest cover and changes in wetlands[@mitchell2015; @adeli2020].
3.  **Agriculture**: Monitor crop growth and farmland management[@mcnairn2016; @liu2019; @dinglerobertson2020].
4.  **Disaster management**: keep abreast of surface changes after natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides[@singhroy2004; @yamaguchi2012; @alali2022].
5.  **Urban planning**: urban development monitoring and infrastructure planning[@ban2012; @colinkoeniguer2020; @ahmed2020].

## Reflection

SAR is an active sensor that captures surface texture data and looks through weather conditions and clouds, which is a game-changing concept for me. It opens up a new realm of possibilities, especially in how we observe and interpret the Earth's surface under different atmospheric conditions. The role of frequency and wavelength in determining image penetration and spatial resolution has fundamentally changed the way I approach remote sensing tasks. It has made me more aware of the need to tailor the selection of SAR data to the specific requirements of a project, taking into account factors such as target characteristics and expected atmospheric conditions
