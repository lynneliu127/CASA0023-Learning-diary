## Summary

### Synthetic Aperture Radar.

1.  Active sensors

2.  Have surface texture data

3.  See through weather and clouds

4.  Different wavelengths - different applications

**Penetration**: Longer wavelengths (L and P bands) can penetrate deeper into vegetation and the ground, making it suitable for subsurface, biomass and soil moisture studies.

**Spatial Resolution**:Shorter wavelengths (X and C bands) generally provide higher spatial resolution, which facilitates detailed mapping and surveillance applications.

**Atmospheric conditions**:Different wavelengths interact significantly with the atmosphere; longer wavelengths are generally less affected by atmospheric humidity.

**Target characteristics**: The nature of the target area (urban, agricultural, forest, etc.) influences the selection of the optimal wavelength for imaging and data extraction.

### InSAR or DInSAR

1.  SAR = Active sensor, records energy reflected back through clouds.
2.  InSAR = Used in DEMs to convert phase differences to relative heights.
3.  DInSAR = time variation between two images. Observe movement of land (uplift or subsidence) with topography removed (using DEM)

## Application

1.  **Topographic mapping**: generation of high-resolution topographic maps and elevation data.
2.  **Environmental monitoring**: observation of environmental changes such as changes in forest cover and changes in wetlands.
3.  **Agriculture**: Monitor crop growth and farmland management.
4.  **Disaster management**: keep abreast of surface changes after natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides.
5.  **Urban planning**: urban development monitoring and infrastructure planning.
6.  **Glacier and polar monitoring**: study of glacier movement and melting, and environmental changes in the polar regions.
