Remote sensors, which provide a global perspective and a wealth of data about Earth systems, enable data-informed decision making based on the current and future state of our planet.\n\n\n1.2.3 Satellite remote sensing\n\n1.2.3.1 Landsat data\nSatellites and sensors: The newest is Landsat 9, launched in 2021, and its predecessors include a series of successful satellites such as Landsat 7 and Landsat 8.\nImage resolution: Landsat 8 and Landsat 9’s Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) provide 30 metre multispectral resolution, 15 metre panchromatic resolution, and 100 metre thermal infrared resolution.\nRevisit Cycle: Every 16 days for complete coverage of the Earth’s surface.\nData Availability: The Landsat project provides decades-long archived data, essential for scientific research and environmental monitoring.\n\n\n1.2.3.2 Sentinel Data\nSatellites and sensors: Includes multiple satellites such as Sentinel-1 (carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR), Sentinel-2 (carrying Multispectral Instrument) and several other satellites focussed on different missions.\nImage resolution: Sentinel-2 provides multispectral data at 10, 20 and 60 metres resolution, superior to most Landsat data.\nRevisit Cycle: Sentinel-2A and 2B can revisit the globe every 5 days, much faster than Landsat’s revisit cycle.\nData Availability: Sentinel data are available in real-time since launch, are easily accessible, and support near real-time applications.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Spectral features\n\nVisible bands: Usually include blue, green and red bands, which are used to capture the colour and reflective properties of the ground surface and are commonly used for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, etc.\nNear infrared (NIR) band: Vegetation has high reflectance in this band and is commonly used for vegetation health assessment, vegetation type differentiation, etc.\nShort-wave infrared band: Provides information on moisture status, vegetation type and fire scars.\nThermal infrared: mainly used for measuring surface temperature, thermal characterisation, and monitoring environmental moisture and drought conditions.\nMid-infrared band: helps to differentiate between different rock and soil types and can also be used to detect the presence of snow, ice and clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral signatures of different Earth features within the visible light spectrum.
