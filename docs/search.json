    "section": "1.2 Application",
    "text": "1.2 Application\nRemote sensing technology has evolved to be widely used in a variety of fields. As urban planners, we usually use remote sensing data to monitor urban sprawl (Bhatta 2010; Shao et al. 2021), manage traffic flow (Macioszek and Kurek 2021a; Chang et al. 2020) and optimise land use (Rogan and Chen 2004; Xie, Lin, and Ren 2011). Remote sensing images can reveal the impact of urban heat island effect through Land Surface Temperature (LST) data (Zhou et al. 2011). In addition, remote sensing technology can provide risk assessment prior to natural disasters and rapidly provide critical information to support rescue and recovery efforts when disasters occur (Nayak and Zlatanova 2008). At the same time, remote sensing technology is vital for monitoring environmental changes and ecosystems. It can track deforestation, desertification processes, and water pollution (Jordan, Ghulam, and Hartling 2014; Macioszek and Kurek 2021b; Lee et al. 2020). In today’s world of global warming, remote sensing technology helps scientists track global sea level rise, temperature changes, and aspects of the carbon cycle by monitoring long-term changes in the Earth’s surface and atmosphere (Schimel et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2020a). The development of remote sensing technology has been advancing rapidly, and the integration of remote sensing data with AI and machine learning is revolutionising the way remote sensing data is processed and analysed (Li et al. 2020b). These technologies are capable of processing large amounts of data, identifying complex patterns, predicting future changes, and automating the interpretation of remotely sensed images, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nIn this week’s study, I found that I need to have a sense of framework before doing the remote sensing analysis exercise, confirming the object and purpose of the analysis, choosing the appropriate sensor, and the appropriate band. It is also necessary to have a clear understanding of the steps of data processing to avoid confusion. This exercise revealed to me that remote sensing technology, despite its power, requires researchers to have an in-depth understanding of the satellite data used and its bands. Choosing the correct bands is critical to ensuring the accuracy of the results of the study, as different bands can reveal different information about the surface. Inadequate choice of bands could lead to meaningless or even misleading analyses.\n\n\n\n\nBhatta, Basudeb. 2010. Analysis of Urban Growth and Sprawl from Remote Sensing Data.

To summarise these guidelines in the context of flood disaster management in Beijing\n\n\n\nUnderstanding disaster risk: Recognise all aspects of flood risk, including vulnerability, capacity and exposure of people and assets, and hazard characteristics. This includes promoting the collection, analysis, management and use of relevant data and practical information, and ensuring its dissemination.\nStrengthening disaster risk management:Strengthen disaster risk management for effective flood risk management. This requires strategies, clear vision, capacity and guidance within and across sectors, and the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\nInvestment in disaster risk reduction: Public and private investments in flood risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential. These investments build economic, social, health and cultural resilience and contribute to innovation, growth and job creation.\n\n\n\nStrengthening disaster preparedness: Preparing for effective response and “building back better” during the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases. This includes the development and maintenance of early warning systems, emergency preparedness plans, and the ability to respond and recover effectively from floods.\nRole of stakeholders: While the primary responsibility for disaster risk reduction lies with the State, it needs to be shared with relevant stakeholders. This includes local communities, the private sector and other non-state stakeholders who can provide knowledge, expertise and resources to disaster risk reduction initiatives.\nInternational co-operation and global partnerships: Emphasis was placed on the need to strengthen international support and partnerships to support national efforts to reduce disaster risk, especially in developing countries such as China. Such support could be in the form of financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building.",

This concept is paramount in the correct interpretation of the information provided by remote sensing satellite images. When analysing these images, various elements may create problems of interpretation. Radiation received by satellites is affected by scattering, absorption and refraction by the atmosphere\n\n3.2.1 Collecting and merging raster images\nAnalysing the whole Spanish island of Mallorca. Mallorca has a land area of 3640 km² and the single image map at Landsat8 in Mallorca is not enough to represent the whole island, we need to merge several to create a mosaic. Mallorca has more than 300 days of clear weather per year, which results in Landsat imagery with clear cloud cover. We chose 2022 we used these 3 panes and placed them in a mosaic to create a full RBG view of the island.\n\n\n\nMallorca Full RGB View\n\n\nWe took images from USGS and used a total of 3 images to cover the entire island. In these 3 images were taken from Landsat 8. 2 of the images were taken on 28 January 2022, and one of them was taken on 20 February 2022. We do not consider this temporal difference between the images to be significant, but we will analyse the implications further.\n\n\n\nMosaic\n\n\nFrom left to right each band is: Band 1 - Coastal Blue Light, Band 2 - Deep Blue Light, Band 3 - Green Light, Band 4 - Red Light, Band 5 - Near Infrared Light, Band 6 - Shortwave Infrared 1 Light, Band 7 - Shortwave Infrared 2 Light. Band 1 - Coastal Blue Light, Band 2 - Deep Blue Light, Band 3 - Green Light, Band 4 - Red Light, Band 5 - Near Infrared Light, Band 6 - Shortwave Infrared 1 Light, Band 7 - Shortwave Infrared 2 Light.\nThe resolution of the bands shown here is 30 m. Bands 8 (15 m), 10, and 11 (100 m) have been omitted because they have different resolutions. Because of the high level of information available in the spectral bands, we can use it to gain additional insight into our research area! Due to 0% cloudiness at the time of data download, this remote sensing data, does not have band 9 (Cirrus Light).",

    "text": "3.4 Reflection\nI found the DOS corrections particularly interesting from the lectures and the actual content - I thought it was a clever and straightforward way to explain atmospheric corrections. The reason I bypassed atmospheric corrections here and focused on enhancements is that the island I chose has good weather all year round, allowing me to reduce my workload. However, I had a big problem doing the PCA because I kept getting errors when I downloaded the shape file to crop the raster, and I confirmed that I had unified the projection, but it still failed to the point that the remote sensing data was so computationally intensive that the amount of data was too large to do the PCA calculations. Last semester, I was first introduced to PCA in the Quantitative Methods module, and in the final assignment, my variables had multicollinearity, so I learnt to use the PCA method for analysis. Now that I understand it anew in terms of spatial relationships, it’s fun to learn more application scenarios for this method.\n\n\n\n\nGarcia, Celso, Arnau Amengual, Víctor Homar, and Alberto Zamora. 2017. “Losing Water in Temporary Streams on a Mediterranean Island: Effects of Climate and Land-Cover Changes.” Global and Planetary Change 148 (January): 139–52. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.11.010.",

    "text": "3.3 NDVI & NDMI\nDue to the fact that Mallorca is an important tourist island in Europe, its beautiful natural seaside scenery attracts many tourists every year.Due to Mallorca’s long hours of sunshine and low rainfall all year round, understanding the vegetation of Mallorca becomes crucial in the face of the ecological impact of water loss in temporary streams (Garcia et al. (2017)). Using the near-infrared and red bands in L-8/9, we can get an idea of the intensity of the vegetation throughout the island.\n\n3.3.1 NDVI\nThe figure below illustrates which areas meet the different NDVI thresholds. We see that a large portion of Mallorca has positive NDVI, but there are some rocky or sandy surface areas in the centre (USGS).\n \n\n\n3.3.2 NDMI\nNDMI is used to determine vegetation water content and is measured similarly to NDVI. Below we provide a similar breakdown for different areas with different thresholds:\nUnsurprisingly, the land area is overwhelmingly positive! In addition, we must keep in mind the timing aspect, as these observations were made during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, when the island of Mallorca usually has moderate temperatures and moderate rainfall. February falls in the middle of winter, which is the month with the lowest temperatures of the year. Because of Mallorca’s Mediterranean climate, winters are mild and summers are hot, sunny and a little sultry, but buffeted by sea breezes. So these values do not fluctuate much throughout the year.\n(Source)",
