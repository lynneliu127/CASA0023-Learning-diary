## Reflection

In this week's exercise, I learnt how to create a web-based PowerPoint using Xaringan.In my undergraduate studies I used to struggle with formatting PowerPoints and I had to spend a lot of time on layout proofreading. I was relieved after learning the Xaringan production technique, there are still several features of Xaringan that I have yet to explore, but I am still pleasantly surprised at how interactive and standardised it is.
